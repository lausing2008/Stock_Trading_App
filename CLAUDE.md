# CLAUDE.md — Persistent Session Notes for Claude Code

This file is read at the start of every session. It documents recurring issues, deployment patterns,
and constraints that must be applied every time.

## Recurring Issue: Login Redirect Loop After Deployment

**Symptom:** After deploying (docker restart), users are redirected to /login. Even after entering
valid credentials, they get redirected back to /login. This happens consistently after every
container restart.

**Root cause:** `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` `request()` function had a 401 handler that
unconditionally deleted the JWT from localStorage and redirected to `/login` on ANY 401 response
— including transient 401s from background calls (like `api.dataFreshness()`) that fire during
container startup. This deleted a still-valid JWT, forcing re-login even when credentials are fine.

**Fix applied (2026-06-15):** `api.ts` 401 handler now checks if the local JWT is actually expired
before removing it. If the local token is still valid (not expired), the JWT is preserved and
the redirect to /login still happens so the user can re-authenticate — but the token is not
silently deleted, preventing the loop.

```
// api.ts — the 401 guard now decodes the local token and only removes it if expired
if (!p.exp || p.exp < Date.now() / 1000) localStorage.removeItem('stockai_jwt');
```

**What to check if this recurs:**
1. Check api-gateway logs: `docker logs stockai-api-gateway-1 --since 2m | grep '401'`
2. Check market-data login: `docker logs stockai-market-data-1 --since 2m | grep 'login'`
3. If `POST /auth/login` returns 200 but user still can't get through: the issue is client-side
   token clearing. Check api.ts 401 handler.
4. If `POST /auth/login` returns 401: check the credentials and DB (bcrypt hash in users table).
5. After any auth.py or market-data change, always test login end-to-end before deploying.

**After deployment, if users can't log in:**
- Ask them to do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) first
- If still broken, check that market-data container started cleanly: `docker logs stockai-market-data-1 | head -30`

## Deployment Pattern

All code changes are deployed via `docker cp` + `docker restart`. Source is baked into images at
build time; live edits use `docker cp` to overwrite files inside running containers.

Container names: `stockai-market-data-1`, `stockai-signal-engine-1`, `stockai-frontend-1`,
`stockai-api-gateway-1`, `stockai-ml-prediction-1`, `stockai-research-engine-1`,
`stockai-ranking-engine-1`, `stockai-strategy-engine-1`, `stockai-technical-analysis-1`,
`stockai-portfolio-optimizer-1`

Key file paths inside containers:
- market-data Python source: `/app/src/`
- signal-engine Python source: `/app/src/`
- frontend Next.js build: `/app/.next/`

Frontend requires `frontend/.env.production` with `API_GATEWAY_URL=http://api-gateway:8000`
before building. This file is gitignored — never commit it.

## Security Constraints

- `.env.production` is gitignored — NEVER commit it
- Never embed real credential values literally in SSH command strings or tool calls
- EC2 SSH: `18.205.121.71`, key: `~/Documents/Stock_AI/lausing.pem`, user: `ec2-user`
- EC2 production domain: `lausing.com`
- JWT secret and DB credentials are in EC2 `.env` file only

---

## Auth Architecture

- JWTs signed with HS256 using `jwt_secret` from env (shared across all services)
- Tokens expire after `JWT_EXPIRE_DAYS` days (typically 1)
- Token blacklist: Redis `auth:blacklist:{jti}` (set on logout) + in-memory fallback dict
- `shared/common/jwt_auth.py` is the canonical verifier (used by api-gateway proxy)
- `services/market-data/src/api/auth.py` handles login/logout/user management
- api-gateway `proxy.py` `_require_auth()` validates every non-public request

---

## Known Ongoing Limitations

- Broker commission: `commission_per_share` defaults to 0.0 (user's broker is commission-free)
- Survivorship bias in ML training data (delisted stocks not included) — requires external data source
- Walk-forward backtest deferred (2+ weeks of work)
- Forward return tracking (INT-8) not yet implemented
