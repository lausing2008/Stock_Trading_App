# CLAUDE.md — Persistent Session Notes for Claude Code

This file is read at the start of every session. It documents recurring issues, deployment patterns,
and constraints that must be applied every time.

## Recurring Issue: Login Redirect Loop After Deployment

**Symptom:** After deploying (docker restart), users are redirected to /login. Even after entering
valid credentials, they get redirected back to /login. This happens consistently after every
container restart.

**Root cause:** `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` `request()` function had a 401 handler that
unconditionally deleted the JWT from localStorage and redirected to `/login` on ANY 401 response
— including transient 401s from background calls (like `api.dataFreshness()`) that fire during
container startup. This deleted a still-valid JWT, forcing re-login even when credentials are fine.

**Fix applied (2026-06-15, updated 2026-06-16):**

Two changes were made to solve this permanently:

1. **`_app.tsx` — lazy state init (prevents blank flash and early redirect):**
   Auth state is now read synchronously from localStorage at first render. If a valid session exists,
   `checked = true` and `username` is populated immediately — no async gap where doCheck() can run
   before finding a session.

2. **`api.ts` — smart 401 handler (prevents token deletion on transient 401s):**
   The handler now decodes the local JWT first. If the token has actually expired, it removes it
   and redirects. If the token is still locally valid, it throws `'Unauthorized'` WITHOUT removing
   the token or redirecting — so transient 401s during container startup don't log out valid users.

3. **`_app.tsx` — freshness poll guarded by `username`:**
   The `api.dataFreshness()` poll now only fires when `username` is set (user is logged in).
   Previously it fired immediately on every page load, causing 401s from unauthenticated pages.

```
// api.ts — only clear the token if it's actually expired
const raw = localStorage.getItem('stockai_jwt');
let expired = true;
if (raw) { try { const p = JSON.parse(atob(raw.split('.')[1]...)); expired = p.exp < Date.now()/1000; } catch {} }
if (expired) { localStorage.removeItem('stockai_jwt'); window.location.href = '/login'; throw ...; }
throw new Error('Unauthorized'); // locally valid but server rejected — don't log out
```

**What to check if this recurs:**
1. Check api-gateway logs: `docker logs stockai-api-gateway-1 --since 2m | grep '401'`
2. Check market-data login: `docker logs stockai-market-data-1 --since 2m | grep 'login'`
3. If `POST /auth/login` returns 200 but user still gets redirected: check `_app.tsx` `doCheck()` —
   `getSession()` must be returning null. Check if decodeJWT is failing (base64 padding issue?).
4. If `POST /auth/login` returns 401: check the credentials and DB (bcrypt hash in users table).
5. After any auth.py or market-data change, always test login end-to-end before deploying.

**After deployment, if users can't log in:**
- Ask them to do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) first
- If still broken, check that market-data container started cleanly: `docker logs stockai-market-data-1 | head -30`
- NEVER add a "smart 401 redirect" that preserves the token AND redirects to /login — this causes
  a loop: login.tsx sees valid token → redirects to / → API returns 401 → redirects to /login → loop.

## Deployment Pattern

**Standard deployment (git-based, preferred):**
1. Commit changes locally on `prod` branch
2. `git push origin prod`
3. SSH to EC2: `ssh -i ~/Documents/Stock_AI/lausing.pem ec2-user@18.205.121.71`
4. On EC2: `cd /home/ec2-user/Stock_Trading_App && git pull origin prod`
   - If there are local changes on EC2 blocking the pull: `git stash && git pull origin prod`
   - If there are untracked files blocking: move them to /tmp first, then pull
5. **Frontend:** needs rebuild: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build frontend && docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d frontend`
6. **Backend services:** `docker cp` changed files to `/app/shared/` (for shared/) and `/app/src/` (for service-specific files), then `docker restart <container>`
   - **IMPORTANT:** `shared/db/models.py` and `shared/common/` must be copied to `/app/shared/db/` and `/app/shared/common/` (NOT `/app/src/db/`!)
   - Use: `docker cp shared/db/__init__.py <container>:/app/shared/db/__init__.py`

Container names: `stockai-market-data-1`, `stockai-signal-engine-1`, `stockai-frontend-1`,
`stockai-api-gateway-1`, `stockai-ml-prediction-1`, `stockai-research-engine-1`,
`stockai-ranking-engine-1`, `stockai-strategy-engine-1`, `stockai-technical-analysis-1`,
`stockai-portfolio-optimizer-1`

Key file paths inside containers:
- market-data Python source: `/app/src/` (service-specific) and `/app/shared/` (shared models)
- signal-engine Python source: `/app/src/` and `/app/shared/`
- frontend Next.js build: `/app/.next/` (built into image during `docker compose build`)

Frontend requires `frontend/.env.production` with `API_GATEWAY_URL=http://api-gateway:8000`
before building. This file is gitignored — never commit it.

## Security Constraints

- `.env.production` is gitignored — NEVER commit it
- Never embed real credential values literally in SSH command strings or tool calls
- EC2 SSH: `18.205.121.71`, key: `~/Documents/Stock_AI/lausing.pem`, user: `ec2-user`
- EC2 production domain: `lausing.com`
- JWT secret and DB credentials are in EC2 `.env` file only

---

## Auth Architecture

- JWTs signed with HS256 using `jwt_secret` from env (shared across all services)
- Tokens expire after `JWT_EXPIRE_DAYS` days (typically 1)
- Token blacklist: Redis `auth:blacklist:{jti}` (set on logout) + in-memory fallback dict
- `shared/common/jwt_auth.py` is the canonical verifier (used by api-gateway proxy)
- `services/market-data/src/api/auth.py` handles login/logout/user management
- api-gateway `proxy.py` `_require_auth()` validates every non-public request

## Known Ongoing Limitations

- Broker commission: `commission_per_share` defaults to 0.0 (user's broker is commission-free)
- Survivorship bias in ML training data (delisted stocks not included) — requires external data source
- Walk-forward backtest deferred (2+ weeks of work)
- Forward return tracking (INT-8) not yet implemented
