## Recurring Issue: SQLAlchemy text() Named Params with PostgreSQL ::type Casts (BUG-6)

**Symptom:** Signal writes silently fail — no exception logged, no rows written. DB signals table
has entries that are days old even though the scheduler appears to be running normally.

**Root cause:** SQLAlchemy `text()` named parameter binding fails when a parameter is immediately
followed by a PostgreSQL `::type` cast shorthand. For example:

```sql
-- BROKEN: SQLAlchemy binds :sid but leaves :sig unbound (sees :sig::signaltype as ambiguous)
INSERT INTO signals VALUES (:sid, :sig::signaltype, :hor::signalhorizon, :rsns::jsonb)
```

The compiled SQL shows `%(sid)s, :sig::signaltype` — `sid` is bound but `sig` is not. psycopg2
receives a literal `:sig::signaltype` string and raises `psycopg2.errors.SyntaxError`. If the
`except Exception` block swallows this, zero rows are written with no visible error.

**Fix (applied 2026-06-21):**
Always use `CAST(:param AS type)` instead of `:param::type` in SQLAlchemy text() queries:

```sql
-- CORRECT: CAST() syntax avoids the :: ambiguity
INSERT INTO signals VALUES (:sid, CAST(:sig AS signaltype), CAST(:hor AS signalhorizon), CAST(:rsns AS jsonb))
```

**Rule:** Never use PostgreSQL `::` cast shorthand with SQLAlchemy `text()` named parameters in
the same expression. This applies to any service using raw SQL with SQLAlchemy.

**What to check if signals go stale:**
```bash
docker logs stockai-signal-engine-1 --since 2h | grep -i 'error\|syntax\|invalid'
# Look for: psycopg2.errors.SyntaxError or "syntax error at or near ":"
```
