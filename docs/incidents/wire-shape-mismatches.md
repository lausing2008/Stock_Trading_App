## Recurring Issue: `/events/overview`'s Nested `top_buys` Is a DIFFERENT Shape Than the Standalone Leaderboard Endpoints — Reused the Wrong Type

**Symptom (found 2026-07-17):** After the Reports tab (`reports.tsx`) shipped, the News & Macro
tab threw a runtime crash — reported by the user as "News and Macro not working." Separately,
`intelligence.tsx`'s Overview tab silently showed blank/dash values for insider top-buy scores,
with no visible error at all.

**Root cause:** `GET /events/overview`'s `insider.top_buys` field is populated server-side by
`get_insider_leaderboard()` (`services/event-intelligence/src/api/routes.py`), which returns
`{stock_id, symbol, company, purchases, sales, net_value}` — confirmed directly against the
real live response. This is a genuinely DIFFERENT shape than `InsiderLeaderItem`
(`{symbol, score, buy_count, sell_count, net_value}`), the type used by the STANDALONE
`GET /events/insider/leaderboard` endpoint. `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`'s `EventIntelOverview`
type wrongly reused `InsiderLeaderItem` for the nested `/events/overview` field, even though
the two endpoints are backed by different code and return different fields. The congress side
happened to escape detection the same way — `CongressLeaderItem` has `net_amount`/
`unique_politicians` which don't exist on `/events/overview`'s actual congress rows either,
it just wasn't hit as hard because `intelligence.tsx`'s congress rendering only read the one
field (`net_amount`) that happens to also exist on the real congress shape by coincidence.

`reports.tsx`'s `NewsTab` called `b.score.toFixed(0)` directly — since the real data has no
`score` field, this threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')`
and crashed the whole tab. `intelligence.tsx`'s Overview tab called the same nonexistent
`item.score` but routed it through a null-safe `fmt()` helper first (`fmt(item.score)` returns
`'—'` for `undefined`) — same underlying type bug, but it degraded to a silently-wrong display
instead of a hard crash, which is why it went unnoticed until the Reports tab's less-defensive
code hit the exact same bug and actually crashed.

**Fix applied (2026-07-17):** Added distinct `OverviewInsiderTopBuy`/`OverviewCongressTopBuy`
types to `api.ts` matching the REAL `/events/overview` response shape, and corrected both
`reports.tsx` and `intelligence.tsx` to read the real fields (`purchases`/`net_value`/`company`)
instead of the wrong borrowed type's fields (`score`/`buy_count`).

**Design invariant:** never assume two endpoints that return "the same kind of data" (here,
"insider top buys") share a wire type just because the field names sound similar — a nested
field on an aggregate/overview endpoint is frequently built by different backend code than the
dedicated single-purpose endpoint for that same concept, and can have a genuinely different
shape. Verify the ACTUAL response shape (a live curl/query) before reusing an existing
TypeScript type for a new call site, especially for aggregate endpoints like `/events/overview`
that pull from multiple internal helper functions. Also: prefer failing loudly (direct field
access) over silently-safe helpers (`fmt()`-style null coalescing) when wiring up a NEW field
for the first time — the silent version can mask a real type mismatch for a long time, exactly
as it did here in `intelligence.tsx`.

**What to check if a similar "endpoint X and Y look like they return the same shape" bug is
suspected:**
```bash
# Query the real live response directly rather than trusting the TypeScript type on file:
docker exec stockai-market-data-1 python3 -c "
import sys, uuid, time; sys.path.insert(0,'/app'); sys.path.insert(0,'/app/src')
from common.config import get_settings; from jose import jwt as _jwt; import httpx
s = get_settings()
tok = _jwt.encode({'sub':'scheduler','jti':str(uuid.uuid4()),'exp':int(time.time())+86400}, s.jwt_secret, algorithm='HS256')
r = httpx.get('http://api-gateway:8000/events/overview', headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {tok}'}, timeout=15)
print(r.json()['insider']['top_buys'][0])
"
```
