## Feature Reference: Congress Trading Data (Two Independent Implementations)

There are TWO separate, non-wire-compatible congress-trading code paths — this is intentional
duplication tracked as architectural debt (see `T233-ARCH-CONGRESS-DEDUP` in
`frontend/src/pages/improvements.tsx`), not a bug, but worth knowing both exist:

1. **`services/market-data/src/api/congress.py`** — `GET /congress/trades`. No DB persistence;
   live-fetches on every request from `_fetch_kadoa()` (or Quiver Quantitative if
   `quiver_api_key` is configured in Settings — richer metadata, $30/mo). Response is
   PascalCase (`Ticker`, `Date`, `Politician`, `Transaction`, `Min`, `Max`, `Party`, `State`,
   `Chamber`, `ReportDate`), binary `Purchase`/`Sale`/`Exchange` transaction type. Consumed by
   `frontend/src/pages/congress.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/insider.tsx`.

2. **`services/event-intelligence/src/services/congress.py`** — `POST /events/sync/congress`
   (scheduled job) writes to the shared `congress_trades` DB table via
   `sync_congress_trades()`; `GET /events/congress/*` reads from it. Response is snake_case
   (`transaction_type`, `politician_name`, etc.), 4-state transaction type
   (purchase/sale/exchange/unknown), and feeds `compute_congress_score()` for catalyst scoring.
   Consumed by `frontend/src/pages/intelligence.tsx` and the catalyst-scoring pipeline.

Both now source from the same kadoa-org feed (see the Recurring Issue section above) but keep
independent parsing/schema — a fix to one's data source does NOT automatically fix the other;
they must each be checked/fixed separately, exactly as happened when the previous free source
died for both simultaneously.
